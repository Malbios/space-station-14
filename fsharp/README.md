# F# experiments

This folder hosts stand-alone F# spikes and tooling so they stay isolated from the main Space Station 14 solution.

- [`Content.BoleroSpike`](Content.BoleroSpike/README.md) – Bolero WebAssembly spike that queries an SS14 server status endpoint.
- [`BoleroSpike.sln`](BoleroSpike.sln) – minimal solution that only contains the spike client project for IDE convenience.
